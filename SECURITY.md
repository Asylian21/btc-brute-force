# Security Policy

## Purpose of This Project

This is an **educational and research project** designed to demonstrate why Bitcoin's cryptography is secure. It is NOT intended for:

- Unauthorized access to Bitcoin wallets
- Theft or appropriation of cryptocurrency
- Any illegal or unethical activities

## Responsible Use

### ✅ Acceptable Use

- Educational purposes and learning about Bitcoin cryptography
- Security research and academic study
- Understanding the mathematical impossibility of brute forcing
- Performance benchmarking of cryptographic operations
- Teaching probability theory and computational limits

### ❌ Prohibited Use

- Attempting to access wallets you do not own
- Claiming funds from addresses you did not create
- Any activity violating local laws or regulations
- Commercial exploitation without proper authorization
- Misleading others about the feasibility of brute forcing

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this codebase:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email the maintainer directly at: infodavidzita@gmail.com
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

## Disclaimer

- This software is provided "AS IS" without any warranties
- Authors are not responsible for misuse or illegal activities
- Running this software does not grant rights to any discovered keys
- You are solely responsible for compliance with your local laws

## Legal Notice

Using this tool to access cryptocurrency that you do not own is likely illegal in most jurisdictions and may constitute:

- Computer fraud
- Theft
- Unauthorized access to computer systems
- Wire fraud

**Know your local laws and use this tool responsibly.**

## Mathematical Reality

The probability of finding a funded Bitcoin address through brute force is:

- Approximately **1 in 10^48** for a specific P2PKH address
- Would require approximately **10^38 years** at 400,000 keys/second
- Effectively impossible with current or foreseeable technology

This project demonstrates this impossibility through practical code.

**Remember:** If brute forcing Bitcoin were practical, Bitcoin would have no value. The fact that Bitcoin is valuable proves this approach doesn't work.
